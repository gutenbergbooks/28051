<h3><a name="HOW_TO_BE_A_GOOD_RADIO_ACTOR" id="HOW_TO_BE_A_GOOD_RADIO_ACTOR"></a><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>

<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off, coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>On July 1, 1776, the Continental Congress of the American
Colonies faced one of the most important crises this
country has ever passed through. Upon what happened
that night depended the fate of the resolution before Congress
which declared that: "These United Colonies are,
and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown,
and that all political connection between them and the
State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved."
This was known as the Lee Resolution, the fate of which
was to be decided by one of the most famous rides in history&mdash;Caesar
Rodney's ride.</p>

<p>Let us begin our story on the morning of July 1, 1776, in
the Continental Congress at Philadelphia. For nearly
three hours the Lee Resolution has been the subject of furious
debate. The members are all excited, anxious, overwrought.
The debate has become bitter, for some of the
members are unalterably opposed to independence. It is
about noon when Dr. Franklin rises to address the Chair:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Mr. President&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>I have sat uneasily, sir, during the furious debate, hoping
that the storm would subside, and the bright sun of reason
would shine upon us through the parting clouds. But, sir,
I am fearful that the storm is gathering with new fury,
and that we may be blown too far from our course to steer
safely into harbor. Perhaps, sir, we should end this debate
which seems to bid fair to wreck our unity. I move you,
sir, that we lay the Lee Resolution on the table.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>
No, no, bring it to a vote!<br />
Yes, lay it on the table!<br />
Let's vote on it now!<br />
Have it over with! [<i>etc.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK [<i>sound of gavel</i>]</p>

<p>Order! Order! Do I hear a second to Dr. Franklin's motion?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>You have heard the motion&mdash;are there any remarks?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Mr. President&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>I believe, sir, with Dr. Franklin, that the debate has lasted
too long; but, sir, I am hopeful that with only a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
delay we may secure unanimous action on the most important
question which has ever been before this body.
With Dr. Franklin's permission, I suggest an amendment,
sir, that the resolution be laid upon the table until tomorrow
morning. [<i>murmurs and comments</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Does Dr. Franklin accept the amendment?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Mr. President, I have only one desire in this matter, and
that is to see this body united and of one mind. If in the
peace of a quiet July afternoon and the tranquillity of a
night's rest we can find that bond which will unite us and
hold us together, I say, yes&mdash;I accept Mr. Rutledge's
amendment. Let us vote upon the Lee Resolution tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>But the first thing tomorrow morning!</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the first thing tomorrow morning. [<i>murmurs of
assent</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK [<i>sound of gavel</i>]</p>

<p>You have heard the motion. Are there any further remarks?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Question! Question! Question!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Those favoring?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;aye&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Contrary minded?&mdash;Carried! [<i>sound of gavel</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>And now, sir, I move we adjourn until nine o'clock tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Before putting Mr. Rutledge's motion to adjourn, I wish
to caution all the members to the greatest secrecy. Whatever
the outcome of our deliberation, we can only cause
harm to ourselves and to our country by divulging what
has been done here. The motion to adjourn is before the
Congress. Those favoring?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;aye&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Contrary minded?&mdash;Carried! [<i>sound of gavel</i>] Congress
is adjourned until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">ALL [<i>confusion and noise</i>]</p>

<p>
It can't be done!<br />
It's useless!<br />
We can never get them to vote with us!<br />
We must be united!<br />
We can never unite on independence!<br />
We must bring this thing about!<br />
Will you join me?<br />
We have no power to vote. [<i>etc.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Rutledge&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, Dr. Franklin?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Please&mdash;may I speak to you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Of course, Doctor&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Sit down here, my boy.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Do you think you can swing the South Carolina delegation
for independence?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>I don't know, Dr. Franklin, but I've invited them to my
lodging to dine with me and talk over the question.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Good, good! Often an excellent meal and a taste of fine
wine carry more conviction than hours of argument. As
I see it now, we must swing South Carolina, Pennsylvania,
and Delaware into line before tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Count on me for South Carolina.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>And I'll take care of Pennsylvania. I think I'll try your
strategy&mdash;I'll invite the delegation to dinner.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Then that leaves Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>I wonder if McKeen of Delaware, who favors independence&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Yes, I know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN [<i>going on</i>]</p>

<p>&mdash;can't swing Dr. Reed in the same way.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, there's McKeen now. Call him over here&mdash;will you,
Rutledge?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Of course. [<i>calling</i>] Oh, Mr. McKeen! Mr. McKeen!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Come over here a moment&mdash;will you, please?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Why, certainly. [<i>coming in</i>] Well, Dr. Franklin, we
had a stormy session this morning.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>All that will be forgotten&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>In victory.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>If only we can make our victory complete.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>What chance is there for Delaware to join us?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>None, I'm afraid. Dr. Reed and I are the only delegates
here&mdash;and he is as unalterably opposed to independence
as I am in favor of it. The vote of Delaware won't count.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>What about getting another favoring delegate here by tomorrow?
Could you do that?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Well, Doctor, I'm afraid it's out of the question. Caesar
Rodney favors the resolution, I know, but he's at home in
Dover, Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Send a postrider for him!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's eighty miles.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Well, that's not impossible. We have until nine o'clock
tomorrow morning&mdash;it's now&mdash;let's see&mdash;just a little
after twelve&mdash;that's nearly twenty-one hours.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But Rodney was very ill when he went home last week.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Perhaps he's better by now. Write him a letter&mdash;send it
by the postrider&mdash;urge upon him the enormous importance
of his getting here by tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Well, I can try it.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Do, Mr. McKeen, for we must have unanimous action on
this question! We must hang together on this, or we'll all
hang separately!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>All right, sir, I'll go to the postrider's at once! Good day.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Good day. And let us pray that Rodney gets here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So McKeen hurried to the postrider's stable. Now the
postrider was to the people of Revolutionary days what
the telegraph or the telephone is to us today. He carried
messages at a very rapid rate, for those days, by changing
horses every ten or fifteen miles.</p>

<p>As McKeen came up to the post stable, he saw the stableman
sitting on a bench, hard at work cleaning a saddle.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Good day, sir.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Day to ye.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I want a postrider.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Wal', postriders are all out, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Oh, too bad! When do you expect one back?</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Dunno fer certain. Mebbe three or four hours&mdash;mebbe
longer.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But look here&mdash;I can't wait that long&mdash;I want one right
away!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>I'm right sorry, sir, but thar ain't nawthin' I kin do about
et. Come back this evenin' and I kin hev a man fer ye,
but not before.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But, look here, my man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>My name's Uriah Clarke&mdash;at yer service.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>All right, Mr. Clarke, I've got to have a postrider to carry
a very important message to Dover, Delaware, to get a
man back here from Dover by nine o'clock tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Dover, Delaware, and back?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Yes, by nine tomorrow morning!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Why, sir, it's nigh onto eighty mile to Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I know it.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Eighty mile thar and eighty mile back&mdash;why, pshaw,
sir, we couldn't do thet under a whole day&mdash;even ef we
hed a rider to send out right now&mdash;which we ain't.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Twenty-five pounds if you'll do it!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>But how kin we? Ain't I jest told ye we ain't got no
riders?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Why can't you go?</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Law, sir, I ain't rode a trip like thet fer years. It 'ud more
than likely kill me.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Fifty pounds if you'll do it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>No, sir!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Name your own sum.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Ye couldn't pay me, sir&mdash;not fer thet ride. I know thet
road like a book&mdash;bad, slow, hard on hoss flesh when ye
take it easy. I'd stave up half my hosses&mdash;not to mention
myself, sir, and I hev a mind fer myself, too.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Change riders&mdash;change your horses oftener&mdash;but make
it you must!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Not ef 'twas a matter of life and death, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's more than that!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Eh? What? What ye talkin' about?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's a matter of life and death for a nation&mdash;our country!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Is et somethin' to do with Congress, sir?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Wal', sir, I'm a Son of Liberty, and et's my sworn duty to
go whar I'm wanted fer liberty, and ef thet's et&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Then I'll go.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I'll pay your price.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Thar won't be no price! I'll git yer man to Philadelphia
tomorrow mornin' ef I hev to carry him myself. Who's
yer man?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Caesar Rodney of Dover, Delaware. Here's a letter for
him.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Caesar Rodney&mdash;I'll fetch him!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p>Hey, Jim! Throw a saddle on thet bay mare! [<i>orders
fade out</i>]</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>For our next scene let us look in at the home of Caesar
Rodney in Dover, Delaware. It is nearly eight o'clock on
the evening of July 1, 1776. Rodney, pale and drawn,
with the languid air of a man but recently out of a sick
bed, is sitting in an easy chair. Mrs. Rodney is hovering
over him with a protecting anxiety&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You're sure you feel strong enough to sit up, Caesar?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Prudence, I'm all right, I tell you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You're sure you're not in any pain?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>No, no, dear, I'm all right&mdash;just weak, that's all.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>Now, Caesar, you just mustn't overtax your strength&mdash;remember
this is only the second day you've been out of
bed.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Yes, dear.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>And the physician said you mustn't overdo.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>All right, dear. I wonder what's happening in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You must get your mind off Congress. You mustn't
worry.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>I know, but&mdash;what date's today?</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>July first&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>July first. Why, today the Lee Resolution was to come
up for final action! Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't there!</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>What's the Lee Resolution?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>It's the most important motion that's come before the
Continental Congress in the two years Congress has been
sitting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>What's it about?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Independence.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You mean to say they're even considering such a thing?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Of course. It's the only thing left for us. We've got to
declare our independence.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>Well, I'm mighty glad you weren't there today to vote
for it.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You'd just have put a rope around your neck.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>And now let us leave the two riders and their heroic effort
against enormous odds to reach Philadelphia in time to
make the decision for independence unanimous. Our next
scene is on the steps of the State House, the morning of
July 2, 1776. The hour for assembling Congress is drawing
near. Thomas McKeen of Delaware is standing on the
steps anxiously waiting and watching for Caesar Rodney.
Dr. Franklin rides up in his carriage and steps out.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Not yet. I've been waiting for an hour.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, I hope he gets here.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>You must have given them a good dinner, Doctor.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>And good advice. [<i>chuckles</i>] Oh, here comes Rutledge.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I hope he's convinced his colleagues from South Carolina.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Good morning, Mr. Rutledge.</p>

<p>Good morning, Doctor&mdash;good morning, McKeen.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>I trust, Mr. Rutledge, your dinner of last evening was as
productive of good results as mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>You can count on South Carolina.</p>

<p>Great news, sir!</p>

How do you do, Doctor?<br />

What news this morning?<br />
Has Rodney come?<br />
How will Pennsylvania vote, Doctor?<br />
Good morning, Mr. Hancock.<br />
Good morning, Dr. Franklin. A fine day, isn't it?<br />
How is it with New Hampshire?<br />
New Hampshire is unanimous, sir.<br />
Good morning, gentlemen.<br />
The hour of assembling is nearly here.<br />
Shall we go in, gentlemen?<br />
How do you do, Dr. Franklin?<br />
Has New York been heard from?<br />
Can we swing Delaware, Mr. McKeen?<br />
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock.<br />
There's no question about it, Mr. Livingston.<br />
No, no, I don't believe we can go so far.<br />
Yes, but we have no alternative. [<i>etc.</i>]<br />

<p>Doctor, ask the members to delay&mdash;hold them a few minutes&mdash;don't
let a quorum assemble.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Yes, yes! [<i>louder</i>] Gentlemen, just a moment.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>
Yes, Doctor, what is it?<br />
What do you want, Dr. Franklin? [<i>etc.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Wait&mdash;wait a moment&mdash;don't go in just yet&mdash;come&mdash;do
you mind standing here with us&mdash;no&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Mr.
Adams, take several members and go up Market
Street!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, certainly, Doctor&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Don't ask me why! We must delay the opening of the
meeting. Come back in a quarter of an hour!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Of course, sir.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>And Livingston, keep the members here on the steps in
conversation&mdash;don't let them go in.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Certainly, Doctor.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, Jefferson, you are always too prompt! My boy, be
late this morning&mdash;stroll about the Square! Take some
of your friends with you&mdash;sh&mdash;don't ask me why&mdash;I
might incriminate myself! It's a beautiful morning for a
stroll&mdash;you need the air, my boy&mdash;you need&mdash;

<p>Oh, Doctor, look!</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Eh? What?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Two horsemen coming up Market Street!</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Is it by any chance&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it's Rodney&mdash;Rodney and the postrider&mdash;they're
coming!</p>

<p>Good, good! This is a glorious day!</p>

Here comes Rodney of Delaware!<br />
Good! That swings Delaware into line!<br />
It looks like unanimous action!<br />
Rodney, Rodney&mdash;good work!<br />

<p>Wal', here we be, Mr. McKeen.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Good! You're just in time!</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>They haven't voted yet?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>No, no, the session is just assembling. Come, dismount!</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>You'll have to give me a hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Here&mdash;I'll help ye. [<i>sound of dismounting</i>]</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>I&mdash;I can hardly stand.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Here, Rodney, take my arm&mdash;I seldom have a chance to
support young and vigorous men now, but I insist on this!</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Thank you, Doctor.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Come&mdash;let me lead you in a triumphant entry!</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>I'm glad I got here in time.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>My congratulations, Rodney&mdash;you've ridden to a great
victory! Before another hour is passed a new nation will
be born! [<i>members cheer</i>]</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke, I want to thank you. I was almost afraid you
wouldn't get him here in time.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Why, pshaw, Mr. McKeen, I give ye my word, didn't I?
I had to git him here!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so Rodney, with his mud-spattered clothes, booted
and spurred as he had ridden, went into the meeting of
Congress and secured the adherence of Delaware to the Lee
Resolution. When Congress was called to order and the
vote taken, every Colony voted for independence, and, as
New York did not vote at all, there was not a dissenting
voice in the victory!</p>
